## Description

- This version of my Portfolio is specifically developed using React, React Router, and TypeScript. It serves as a showcase of my projects, skills, and experience, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.
Some views in this project utilize specific dependencies and components. It's important to note that views *do not* use all dependencies or components, but _they are shared_ across multiple views.
